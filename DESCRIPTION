Title: Generates APA Tables, Figures, and Appendix Sections
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Todd",
           family = "Goodrich",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "toddagood@gmail.com")
Description: Generates an output Word file (docx) containing bookmarked
    content (tables, figures, and appendices) numbered and organized
    in APA style sections.  In each output section, the content is ordered
    by the first reference to the content within an input Word file.  The
    output file is designed to be included into the input file using
    a Word field {INCLUDETEXT "output_file.docx"} so that bookmarks
    in the output file can be referenced from the input file.
    Planned enhancements: Use a styles list to italicize statistics and
    variables in axis titles and the legend title, similar to
    ggtext::element_markup() but driving the formating from a styles list
    without requiring any markup.
