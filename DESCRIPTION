Title: Generates APA Tables, Figures, and Appendix Sections
Version: 0.10.1
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Todd",
           family = "Goodrich",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "toddagood@gmail.com")
Description: Generates an output Word file (docx) containing bookmarked
    content (tables, figures, and appendices) numbered and organized
    in APA style sections.  In each output section, the content is ordered
    by the first reference to the content within an input Word file.  The
    output file is designed to be included into the input file using
    an "IncludeText" field in Word so that bookmarks
    in the output file can be referenced from the input file.
    This package primarily uses the officer and flextable packages, but
    the difference here is the obsession with conforming to the APA
    style guide.
