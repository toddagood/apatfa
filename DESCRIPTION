Title: Generates APA Tables, Figures, and Appendix Sections
Version: 0.7.1
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Todd",
           family = "Goodrich",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "toddagood@gmail.com")
Description: Generates an output Word file (docx) containing bookmarked
    content (tables, figures, and appendices) numbered and organized
    in APA style sections.  In each output section, the content is ordered
    by the first reference to the content within an input Word file.  The
    output file is designed to be included into the input file using
    a Word field {INCLUDETEXT "output_file.docx"} so that bookmarks
    in the output file can be referenced from the input file.  This package
    primarily uses the officer and flextable packages, but the difference
    here is the obsession with conforming to the APA style guide.  For example,
    in APA style numeric table columns should be center-aligned and at the
    same time should be decimal-aligned, which flextables do not support but
    apatfa supports that and does it by default.  See help("apatfa-package")
    for details on how to use apatfa to write a paper in APA style.
